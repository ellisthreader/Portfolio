            I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
            experience using modern frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, and
            Angular. On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express, Django, and
            Flask. I am proficient in managing databases including both SQL
            (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase). I also use Git with
            platforms like GitHub and GitLab for version control and collaboration.

            I specialize in creating responsive, accessible designs with a focus on
            strong UI/UX principles. I have experience using design tools such as
            Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch for prototyping, and I build modern,
            user-friendly interfaces with frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap, and
            Material UI.

            Beyond core web development, I have experience with data
            visualization using D3.js, Chart.js, and Recharts, as well as a
            foundational understanding of machine learning with scikit-learn and
            TensorFlow. I also explore mobile development with React Native and
            Flutter, and enjoy building interactive experiences with tools such as
